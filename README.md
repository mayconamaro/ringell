# ringell
A work-in-progress compiler that ensures termination

The first version code and quick check tests are on separate folders (and separate projects). Go to folder "Property based tests" for a more up to date version of the core algorithms. Go to "compiler first versions" if you want to interact with Ringell. Both projects will be synchronized before the ending of my master's.
